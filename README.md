Instructions for hitting API Endpoints:
1. Download the Postman Desktop App
2. Sign in to the app (create an account if you haven't already)
3. Turn off SSL certificate verification via File > Settings > SSL Certificate Verification 
* Since the SSL certificate is local, it can't be verified. make sure to turn this setting back on if you are hitting public endpoints (we won't be for this project)')
4. Go to Solution View and run IIS Express (if you aren't already)
5. Enter the desired endpoint in Postman and hit "Send" (sample endpoint: https://localhost:44397/weatherforecast)
